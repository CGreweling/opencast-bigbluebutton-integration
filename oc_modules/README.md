Post Processing Modules
========================

This folder contains custom Ruby modules that are required by the post processing scripts to run properly.

To install them, place this folder with all its files into the same directory as the post processing script you are using.
The path should then look something like this (the * start stands for either `archive` or `publish`, depending on
which script you are using):

    /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_*/oc_modules
